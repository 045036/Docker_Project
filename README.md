Introduction
Kanboard is an open-source project management software that focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It is a Kanban-based tool that helps teams track project progress and manage tasks effectively. This project sets up Kanboard using Docker, which allows you to quickly deploy and run Kanboard in an isolated environment.

This repository contains the steps and configuration needed to run Kanboard with Docker.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

Docker (version 19.03 or higher)
A working internet connection to download the Docker image
Installation
To get started with Kanboard in Docker, follow the steps below.

Pull Command
First, pull the Kanboard Docker image from Docker Hub:

bash
Copy code
docker pull kanboard/kanboard
This command will download the Kanboard Docker image to your system.

Run Command
Once the image is pulled, you can run Kanboard as a Docker container. Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name kanboard -p 8080:80 -d kanboard/kanboard
--name kanboard: Assigns the name "kanboard" to your running container.
-p 8080:80: Maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your local machine, allowing you to access Kanboard at http://localhost:8080.
-d: Runs the container in detached mode, meaning it will run in the background.
Usage
After running the container, Kanboard will be available at http://localhost:8080. You can now access the Kanboard interface and start using it to manage your projects and tasks.

Accessing the Application
Open your web browser.
Go to http://localhost:8080.
The Kanboard login page will appear.
Default login credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin
Once logged in, you can begin creating projects, managing tasks, and organizing your team's work.

Troubleshooting
Container Not Starting
If the container does not start correctly, ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine. You can check the logs of the container to get more information by running:

bash
Copy code
docker logs kanboard
Port Conflicts
If port 8080 is already in use by another service, you can map a different port by modifying the -p flag in the docker run command. For example:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name kanboard -p 9090:80 -d kanboard/kanboard
This would make Kanboard accessible at http://localhost:9090.
